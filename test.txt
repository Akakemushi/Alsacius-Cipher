True story: One night I was hanging out with some friends at a local bar.  We took a break to get some air outside, and went to a nearby conbini to grab something to eat.  When I got inside, there was one other customer already in there, an old Japanese man.  He was just browsing the alcohol section, and I was just being nice, so I said "atsui desu ne".  He smiled and mumbled something at me, and I went on to find a sandwich.  At the checkout, the man was in front of me and my friends in line, and after he paid, he turned around, saw me, said, "chinchin dekai desu ne!" and then slapped me directly in the nuts...  he then just gave me the entire bag of alcohol he just bought... and walked out of the store.  I was standing there holding my nuts in one hand and the bag of alcohol in the other with a look of pain and "WTF just happened??" on my face.  The combini clerk looked horrified, and was like, "I got no idea man, don't look at me..." and my friends were equally confused.  I will never forget you old Japanese man, wherever you are.
